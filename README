[CS 631] Final Assignment - Write a Simple Shell (sish)
David Sevilla

Known Bugs:
- Redirection operators are only correctly parsed if they are not whitespace
  separated from the corresponding filename. e.g. Only `echo foo >bar` works,
  not `echo foo > bar`

Considerations:
- Extra arguments are ignored. Note that sh(1) has similar behavior when run
  with the -c option. For example, the following invocations ignore "foo":
  e.g. `sish foo`, `sish -x foo -c bar`, `sish -c bar foo`

Additional tests considered:
sish$ ^C
  - Prints newline and prompt string
sish$ yes
  - Follow by ^C to test whether prompt string is printed properly
    (requires changing signal handler behavior)
sish$ cat <file >file
  - Truncates file, similar to sh(1)
sish$ echo foo >bar >baz >boing
  - Creates / truncates bar and baz files, and only writes "foo" to boing,
    similar to sh(1)
sish$ ^D
  - Write EOF to buffer, terminating the shell, like sh(1)
sish$ cat <<file >>>file
  - Yields a command parsing error, but still prints full command under tracing
    mode
