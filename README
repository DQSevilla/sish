[CS 631] Final Assignment - Write a Simple Shell (sish)
David Sevilla

Known Bugs:
- Redirection operators are only correctly parsed if they are not whitespace
  separated from the corresponding filename. e.g. Only `echo foo >bar` works,
  not `echo foo > bar`

Considerations:
- Extra arguments are ignored. Note that sh(1) has similar behavior when run
  with the -c option. For example, the following invocations ignore "foo":
  e.g. `sish foo`, `sish -x foo -c bar`, `sish -c bar foo`
